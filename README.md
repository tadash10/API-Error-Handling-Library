# API-Error-Handling-Library
API Error Handling Library for Securing API Requests and Responses
Install Python on your system if it's not already installed. You can download the latest version from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download or clone your Python script from the repository.

Open the terminal on your system and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Python script.

Create a virtual environment for the script using the following command:

python3 -m venv venv

This will create a new virtual environment in a folder named 'venv'.

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

bash

source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies for the script using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the script using the following command:

python3 script.py

This will run the Python script and you can use the command-line interface to interact with the script.

When you're done using the script, you can deactivate the virtual environment using the following command:

deactivate

This will deactivate the virtual environment and return you to your system's default Python environment.
